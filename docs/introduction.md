# Introduction to Homelab Management

## What is a Homelab?

A homelab is a personal computing environment where you can experiment, learn, and run various services and applications. It typically consists of:

- Raspberry Pis
- Desktop computers

2. **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure all devices are configured the same way
3. **Version Control**: Track changes to your infrastructure configuration
4. **Easy Recovery**: Quickly rebuild or restore devices if needed
5. **Documentation as Code**: Your infrastructure setup is documented in the code itself
